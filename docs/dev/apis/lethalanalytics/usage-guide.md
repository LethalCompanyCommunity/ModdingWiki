# Usage Guide

## Overview
- Google Analytics
	- [Creating a GA session](/dev/apis/lethalanalytics/usage-guide/creating-a-ga-session/)
	- [Sending GA events](/dev/apis/lethalanalytics/usage-guide/sending-ga-events/)
	- [Creating a GA4 property](/dev/apis/lethalanalytics/usage-guide/creating-a-ga4-property/) (if you've never used Google Analytics before)

The next few pages will tell you everything you need to know about how to get your mod connected with analytics. As of now, LethalAnalytics only supports Google Analytics (GA4) properties and events. Once other sites are supported, this documentation will be updated.
