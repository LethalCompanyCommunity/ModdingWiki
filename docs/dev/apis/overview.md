# Modding APIs Overview

There are two types of API that will be covered in this overview:

- Asset API: An API or custom content mod that can be used without writing any code. Good if you want something simple that even non-programmers can create something with.
- Programming API: A user-created modding API that can be intergrated into your C# Lethal Company mod.

There may be multiple APIs for a single concept, each with their own pros and cons.

APIs marked with a `Gold Star ⭐` have a tutorial on this wiki.

If you're an API developer and want to get your API added to this list, feel free to make a [pull request](https://github.com/LethalCompany/ModdingWiki), assuming your API meets the following criteria:

- Open source
- Fairly well documented - even better if you write a wiki article<sup>[1](#fn-1)</sup>

<b id="fn-1" style="color: var(--vp-c-brand-1);">1</b>: Some exceptions may be made if it's an especially groundbreaking API, or it's the only existing solution.
