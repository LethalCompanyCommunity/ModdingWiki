### What can you do with mods?

You can:
- Play custom maps with [*Monke Map Loader*](https://monkemaphub.com/)
- Customize your gorilla with custom materials, infected materials, and hats with [*Gorilla Cosmetics*](https://github.com/legoandmars/GorillaCosmetics)
- Add various modes like "Super Monke", "Tag Gun", and "Speed Boost" with [*Monke Mod Menu*](https://github.com/jeydevv/MonkeModMenu)
- Jump high with [*Space Monke*](https://github.com/legoandmars/SpaceMonke)
- Enhance the gorilla computer, see your currently loaded mods, change monitor POV, and more with [*Computer Interface*](https://github.com/ToniMacaroni/ComputerInterface)

More mods will be developed as time progresses, and will be published in the **Downloads** category on the [GorillaTag Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/b2MhDBAzTv).

### Is modding the game safe?

Modding the game is allowed by the developers of Gorilla Tag, however keep in mind the following:

!> The use of mods inside public lobbies is forbidden by the developers and can result in a ban. Please keep mods contained to private lobbies. **Most mods automatically disable joining public lobbies, but please be careful.**

### End Goal

This guide has the end goal of taking a completely unmodified Gorilla Tag installation from vanilla to modded with BepInEx (PC) or QuestLoader (Quest).
